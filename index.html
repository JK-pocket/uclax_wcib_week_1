      Hi, this is Jessica I will be your student for this Spring/21. I am using an IMac and I am glad to learn about this process; I have some many question, I have the why for all, why it will run only in Chrome? what is the Dream Shield protection? If I chose SSH there are a lot type, why I have to chose bin/bash what in mean that... and so on. Therefore, this class will be more practice than theory?
